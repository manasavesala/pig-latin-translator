## Description

_For words beginning with a vowel, adds "way" to the end.

For words beginning with one or more consonants, moves all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and adds "ay".

If the first consonants include "qu", moves the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!

For words beginning with "y", treats "y" as a consonant._
